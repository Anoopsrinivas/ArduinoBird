# ArduinoBird
School project - Flappy Bird clone made for Arduino using 8x8 matrix display with MAX7219, one button and LedControl library.

Probably not a good practice, but variables names etc. I wrote mostly in Polish, so be aware of that.

Components used:
- Arduino Uno R2
- 8x8 Matrix Display with MAX7219
- Button
- 220 Ohm Resistor
- Bunch of cables
